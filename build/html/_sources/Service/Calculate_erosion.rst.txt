Compute Wind and Water Erosion 
================================

Calculate Wind Erosion
_________________________
To compute the index of land susceptibility to wind erosion and wind erosion factors, select the |erosion1| option on the service menu bar and follow these simple stesps.



1. Click on the |windbtn| option on the indicator menu options for the layer settings pannel to pop-up as shown below. Select the wind erosion factor to compute or the wind erosion sensitivity index from the 'WIND EROSION SENSITIVITY' list of options

2. Select the reporting year to compute and click on the |submit| button to compute the selected wind erosion factor or wind erosion sensitivity index. The results should be computed and displayed as shown below.

Calculate Water Erosion
________________________

To compute the soil loss and soil loss factors, select the |erosion1| option on the service menu bar and follow these simple stesps.


1. Click on the |waterbtn| option on the indicator menu options for the layer settings pannel to pop-up as shown below. Select the soil loss or soil loss factor to compute from the 'WATER EROSION FACTORS' dropdown list.

2. Chose the reporting period and click on the |submit| button to compute the selected soil loss factor chosen in the previous step. The results will be computed and the output map and summary statistics displayed as shown below.
